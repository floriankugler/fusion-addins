# BaseComponent Object

Derived from: [Base](Base.md) Object  

## Description

The BaseComponent object that defines all of the common design data and is the base class for the product specific components.

## Methods

| Name | Description |
|----|----|
| [allOccurrencesByComponent](BaseComponent_allOccurrencesByComponent.md) | Returns all occurrences, at any level of the assembly, that reference the specified component. The returned list is read-only. |
| [classType](BaseComponent_classType.md) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [findBRepUsingPoint](BaseComponent_findBRepUsingPoint.md) | Finds all the entities of the specified type at the specified location. |
| [findBRepUsingRay](BaseComponent_findBRepUsingRay.md) | Finds all the B-Rep entities that are intersected by the specified ray. This can return BRepFace, BrepEdge, and BRepVertex objects. |
| [occurrencesByComponent](BaseComponent_occurrencesByComponent.md) | Returns all occurrences at the top-level of this component that reference the specified component. The returned list is read-only. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [allOccurrences](BaseComponent_allOccurrences.md) | Returns all of the occurrences in the assembly regardless of their level within the assembly structure. The returned list is read-only. |
| [bRepBodies](BaseComponent_bRepBodies.md) | Returns the B-Rep bodies collection associated with this component. |
| [canvases](BaseComponent_canvases.md) | Returns the canvases collection associated with this component. This provides access to the existing canvases and supports the creation of new canvases. |
| [constructionAxes](BaseComponent_constructionAxes.md) | Returns the construction axes collection associated with this component. This provides access to the existing construction axes and supports the creation of new construction axes. |
| [constructionPlanes](BaseComponent_constructionPlanes.md) | Returns the construction planes collection associated with this component. This provides access to the existing construction planes and supports the creation of new construction planes. |
| [constructionPoints](BaseComponent_constructionPoints.md) | Returns the construction points collection associated with this component. This provides access to the existing construction points and supports the creation of new construction points. |
| [dataComponent](BaseComponent_dataComponent.md) | Returns the DataComponent associated with this component. The DataComponent provides ID information that can be used to access this component using the MFG DM API. These ID's don't exist until a component has been saved. The ID's are generated by MFG DM API on the cloud, so there will be a slight delay after saving before the ID's are available. This property returns null in the case the MFG DM API information doesn't exist yet. When opening a design, the MFG DM API information is obtained from the cloud and as a result may not be available immediately after opening a document. Again, this property will return null in this case too. Essentially, null is returned in all cases where good ID information is not yet available. |
| [decals](BaseComponent_decals.md) | Returns the decals collection associated with this component. This provides access to the existing decals and supports the creation of new decals. |
| [isValid](BaseComponent_isValid.md) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [name](BaseComponent_name.md) | Property that gets and sets the name of this component. This is the name shown in the browser for each occurrence referencing this component. |
| [objectType](BaseComponent_objectType.md) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. It's often useful to use this in combination with the classType method to see if an object is a certain type. For example: if obj.objectType == adsk.core.Point3D.classType(): |
| [occurrences](BaseComponent_occurrences.md) | Property that returns the Occurrences collection associated with this component. This provides access to the occurrences at the top-level of this component and provides the functionality to add new occurrences. |
| [parentDesign](BaseComponent_parentDesign.md) | Returns the parent product this component is owned by. |
| [propertyGroups](BaseComponent_propertyGroups.md) | Returns the PropertyGroups object associated with this component. |
