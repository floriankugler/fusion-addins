# ChordLengthFilletEdgeSetInput Object

Derived from: [FilletEdgeSetInput](FilletEdgeSetInput.md) Object  

## Description

Provides access to the edges and the parameter associated with a chord length fillet.

## Methods

| Name | Description |
|----|----|
| [classType](ChordLengthFilletEdgeSetInput_classType.md) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [chordLength](ChordLengthFilletEdgeSetInput_chordLength.md) | Gets and sets a ValueInput object that defines the chord length of the fillet. If the ValueInput uses a real value then it is interpreted as centimeters. If it is a string then the units can be defined as part of the string (i.e. "2 in") or if no units are specified it is interpreted using the current document units for length. |
| [continuity](ChordLengthFilletEdgeSetInput_continuity.md) | Gets and sets the continuity of the fillet edge set. Valid values are TangentSurfaceContinuityType and CurvatureSurfaceContinuityType. The default is TangentSurfaceContinuityType. For an asymmetric fillet edge set, this must always be tangent continuity (G1) and setting it to another value will fail. |
| [entities](ChordLengthFilletEdgeSetInput_entities.md) | Gets and sets the entities associated with this fillet edge set. For constant radius and chord length edge sets, this can be edges, faces, and features. For variable radius edges sets, this must be edges. |
| [isValid](ChordLengthFilletEdgeSetInput_isValid.md) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectType](ChordLengthFilletEdgeSetInput_objectType.md) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. It's often useful to use this in combination with the classType method to see if an object is a certain type. For example: if obj.objectType == adsk.core.Point3D.classType(): |
| [tangencyWeight](ChordLengthFilletEdgeSetInput_tangencyWeight.md) | Gets and sets the tangency weight for the given edge set. The tangency weight controls the influence of the continuity (G1 or G2) on the fillet. The ValueInput must be a real value between 0.1 and 2.0 inclusive, with no units. The default value is 1.0. |
