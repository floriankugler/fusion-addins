## Description

| Name | Description |
|----|----|
| [classType](UserInterfaceGeneralEventArgs_classType.md) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string.

| [objectType](UserInterfaceGeneralEventArgs_objectType.md) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. It's often useful to use this in combination with the classType method to see if an object is a certain type. For example: if obj.objectType == adsk.core.Point3D.classType(): |
