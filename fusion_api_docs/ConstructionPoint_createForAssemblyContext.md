# ConstructionPoint.createForAssemblyContext Method

Parent Object: [ConstructionPoint](ConstructionPoint.md)  

## Description

Creates or returns a proxy for the native object - i.e. a new object that represents this object but adds the assembly context defined by the input occurrence.

## Syntax

"constructionPoint_var" is a variable referencing a [ConstructionPoint](ConstructionPoint.md) object.

```python
returnValue = constructionPoint_var.createForAssemblyContext(occurrence)
```

## Return Value

| Type | Description |
|----|----|
| [ConstructionPoint](ConstructionPoint.md) | Returns the proxy object or null if this isn't the NativeObject. |

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| occurrence | [Occurrence](Occurrence.md) | The occurrence that defines the context to create the proxy in. |

## Samples

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Create Setups From Hole Recognition API Sample](CreateSetupsFromHoleRecognition_Sample.md) | This sample script demonstrates how to create a correctly oriented setup using Hole Recognition functionality. The Fusion Manufacturing Extension is required for Hole Recognition. The script starts by opening a sample model from the CAM Samples folder via its URN. The model comprises a 3 way coupling containing holes in various orientations and mounted on a fixture. A reference setup is created for the model using a simple stock mode and offsets. The Hole Recognition feature of the Fusion Manufacturing Extension creates 5 hole groups containing 11 holes between them. For each unique hole group vector captured, a new setup is created and its orientation transformed to match the vector. |
| [Set Vise Origin As Setup WCS Origin API Sample](SetViseOriginAsSetupWCSOrigin_Sample.md) | This sample script demonstrates how to define our setup WCS origin relative to our vise origin from either a component, a sketch point or a joint origin. The Work Coordinate System is a reference point set in our CAM workspace and on our machine. All machine coordinates are drawn from the WCS. This script demonstrates defining the WCS by each of 4 alternative methods: Setup by default with no origin defined. Setup using vise origin as WCS origin. Setup using a sketch point as WCS origin. Setup using a joint origin as WCS origin. |
