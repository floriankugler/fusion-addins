# AdditivePlatformMachineElement Object

Derived from: [MachineElement](MachineElement.md) Object  

## Description

Machine element representing the additive platform settings.

## Methods

| Name | Description |
|----|----|
| [classType](AdditivePlatformMachineElement_classType.md) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [staticTypeId](AdditivePlatformMachineElement_staticTypeId.md) | Identifying name for all elements of this type. Pass this to the itemByType or itemById methods of MachineElements to filter to elements of this type. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ceilingClearance](AdditivePlatformMachineElement_ceilingClearance.md) | Clearance height used for automatically arranging parts which is the distance from the top of the build platform. Units are cm. |
| [clearance](AdditivePlatformMachineElement_clearance.md) | Clearance height used for automatically arranging parts and suggested height for positioning part on the build platform. Units are cm. |
| [cornerRadius](AdditivePlatformMachineElement_cornerRadius.md) | Radius used to round the corners of the build platform. Units are cm. |
| [elementId](AdditivePlatformMachineElement_elementId.md) | Identifier for this element. Unique within an element type. |
| [frameWidth](AdditivePlatformMachineElement_frameWidth.md) | Clearance width used for automatically arranging parts which is the distance from the edges of the build platform. Units are cm. |
| [isValid](AdditivePlatformMachineElement_isValid.md) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectType](AdditivePlatformMachineElement_objectType.md) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. It's often useful to use this in combination with the classType method to see if an object is a certain type. For example: if obj.objectType == adsk.core.Point3D.classType(): |
| [origin](AdditivePlatformMachineElement_origin.md) | Origin point specifying the platform coordinates that correspond to the origin of the platform mesh. Units are cm. |
| [size](AdditivePlatformMachineElement_size.md) | Usable platform size. Units are cm. |
| [typeId](AdditivePlatformMachineElement_typeId.md) | Identifier for this type of machine element. |

## Samples

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Additive Manufacturing MJF API Sample](AdditiveMJFManufacturingSample_Sample.md) | Demonstrates how to automate the creation of an additive MJF manufacturing setup and arrange components within the build volume of a 3D printer. To run the sample script, have a design with one or more components open in Fusion’s DESIGN workspace. This script will switch the UI from the DESIGN workspace to the MANUFACTURE workspace, create a new Manufacturing Model, and create an Additive Arrange using that manufacturing model as an input. The setup will select an MJF 3D printer from Fusion’s machine library and a print setting from the print setting library. All components in the Manufacturing model will be automatically arranged within the build volume of the selected MJF machine. |
