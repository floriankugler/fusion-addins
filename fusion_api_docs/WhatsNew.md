# What's New For the January 2026 Release

### Enhancements

1.  **Changes to Support Design Intent**

    This release introduces a new design-intent experience with three design types: hybrid, part, and assembly. Hybrid is the design type that Fusion has always supported. The part and assembly design types are new. If you use the hybrid design type, there is no change. However, for part or assembly designs, there are significant changes to the user interface and how Fusion behaves. This also affects add-in commands, and most will need to be updated to handle it correctly.

    In most cases, the API has the same capabilities and limitations as the user interface. However, there is currently one exception: the API allows the creation of new internal components, which is not possible through the user interface. It is unclear whether this capability will remain in the future, so it is recommended that add-ins do not rely on this behavior.

    As a user, if you need access to the functionality provided by an add-in that has not yet been updated, you can revert to using a hybrid design.

2.  **Python Update**  
    This Fusion release updates the Python version from 3.12 to 3.14. Besides the API, Fusion uses Python for a few other things, and this Python update includes some security fixes. Most people won't notice any change. Those affected are the developers and users of any Python apps delivered as .pyc files. Previous versions of these add-ins will fail to load because .pyc files are tied to the minor version of Python that was used to create them. This change does not affect any add-ins where the .py source code is available. This change only applies to the embedded Python runtime shipped with Fusion and is independent of any system-installed Python.

    If you deliver apps as pyc files, you need to test your add-in and rebuild it to get new pyc files that you can make available to your users.

    If you're a user and are seeing the message shown below when you start Fusion, you have an impacted add-in and need a new version. Check the Autodesk App Store or the developer's website to download a new compatible version, install it, and continue using it as before. If you can't find an updated app, contact the app developer directly.

3.  **API Support for Derive**  

    All entity types that support being derived now provide an `isDerived` property, which indicates whether the entity was derived into the current design. If this is true, the entity behaves as read-only. These entities also support a new `deriveFeature` property, which returns the Derive feature that created the entity when `isDerived` is true.

4.  **Sketch Auto Constrain**  
    The API now supports the auto constraint functionality in sketch. This functionality is exposed as a preview API, so please use it and provide feedback on what you liked or didn't like.

5.  **User Interface Themes**  

6.  **API For the New Assembly Constraint Functionality is Still in Progress**  
    The July release began introducing some of the API for the new assembly constraint functionality. It is a preview feature, and since July, the functionality in Fusion has been modified, necessitating an API change. The changes are still ongoing, so nothing has changed since then. However, we will be introducing a new Constraints API in the future, so if you start using this API, be aware that your existing code will need to be updated to function correctly.

### Fixes

1.  corbin2 reported a problem on the [forum](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-api-and-scripts-forum/intersection-fails-with-runtimeerror-2-internalvalidationerror/td-p/13854425) about a failure when using ThroughAllExtent to extrude sketch text. This has been fixed.

### Custom Features

Custom Features is a new functionality that is currently in preview. This release has nothing new for custom features, but we still encourage you to try it and let us know your thoughts. You can learn more about it in the [Custom Feature](CustomFeatures_UM.md) topic in the API User Manual. There are also two add-in samples referenced in that document that you can use to see the functionality.

This functionality is provided as a preview of intended future API capabilities. You are encouraged to use it and report any problems or suggestions using the [Fusion API and Scripts Forum](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-api-and-scripts-forum/bd-p/fusion-api-scripts-forum-en). However, because this previews future functionality, it may change, breaking any existing programs that use it. Therefore, you should never deliver programs that utilize any preview capabilities.

## New Objects

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AutoConstrainInput](AutoConstrainInput.md) | The AutoConstrainInput object is used to define the various options when adding dimension and geometric constraints to help constrain a sketch. |
| [AutoConstrainResult](AutoConstrainResult.md) | Enhancements The only UI themes available are light gray and dark blue. (Update User Manual to cover this.) Changes to Support Design Intent This release introduces a new design-intent experience with three design types: hybrid, part, and assembly. Hybrid is the design type that Fusion has always supported. The part and assembly design types are new. If you use the Hybrid design type, there is no change. However, for part or assembly designs, there are significant changes to the user interface and how Fusion behaves. This also affects add-in commands, and most will need to be updated to handle it correctly. For more information about this, see the new [Programming for Design Intent](DesignIntent_UM.md) topic in the API User Manual. If you need access to the functionality provided by an add-in that hasn't been updated, you can always revert back to using a hybrid design. Some new functionality has been added to the API to support this. These are the [Design.designIntent](Design_designIntent.md), [Design.isModelingInAssemblyEnabled](Design_isModelingInAssemblyEnabled.md), [Occurrences.addNewExternalComponent](Occurrences_addNewExternalComponent.md), and the Spur Gear sample program has been updated to support the new design types fully. Some of the other samples have been modified to check that you're in the required design type and will exit with a warning if you're not. Python Update This Fusion release updates the Python version from 3.12 to 3.14. Besides the API, Fusion uses Python for a few other things, and this Python update includes some security fixes. Most people won't notice any change. Those affected are the developers and users of any Python apps delivered as .pyc files. Previous versions of these add-ins will be broken because .pyc files are tied to the minor version of Python that was used to create them. Add-ins compiled with the current version (3.12) will not be compatible with the new release (3.14) and will fail to load. This change does not affect any add-ins where the .py source code is available. If you deliver apps as pyc files, you need to test your add-in and rebuild it to get new pyc files that you can make available to your users. If you're a user and are seeing the message shown below when you start Fusion, you have an impacted add-in and need a new version. Check the Autodesk App Store or the developer's website to download a new compatible version, install it, and continue using it as before. If you can't find an updated app, contact the app developer directly. API Support for Derive The API now supports deriving components. This includes the ability to create, query, and edit a Derive feature and to query the entities that can be derived to determine if they were derived, and if they were, which derive feature created them. Sketch Auto Constrain The API now supports the auto constraint functionality in sketch. This functionality is a preview, so please use it and provide feedback on what you liked or didn't like. User Interface Themes With the introduction of the dark user interface theme in Fusion, only two themes are now supported: light gray and dark blue. The [User Manual topic on the user interface](UserInterface_UM.htm#IconsForCommands) has been updated to discuss the icons used for different themes. API For the New Assembly Constraint Functionality is Still in Progress The July release began introducing some of the API for the new assembly constraint functionality. It is a preview feature, and since July, the functionality in Fusion has been modified, necessitating an API change. The changes are still ongoing, so nothing has changed in the November release. However, they will change in January, so if you start using this API, be aware that your existing code will need to be updated to function correctly.
