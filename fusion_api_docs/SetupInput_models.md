# SetupInput.models Property

Parent Object: [SetupInput](SetupInput.md)  

## Description

A list of models, where a model can be an Occurrence, BRepBody, or MeshBody. The returned array is connected to the SetupInput and can be added to directly without needing to create a new array, populate it, and assign it using this property, although, that is supported too.

## Syntax

"setupInput_var" is a variable referencing a SetupInput object.  

```python
# Get the value of the property.
propertyValue = setupInput_var.models

# Set the value of the property.
setupInput_var.models = propertyValue
```

## Property Value

This is a read/write property whose value is an array of type [Base](Base.md).

## Samples

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Additive Manufacturing MJF API Sample](AdditiveMJFManufacturingSample_Sample.md) | Demonstrates how to automate the creation of an additive MJF manufacturing setup and arrange components within the build volume of a 3D printer. To run the sample script, have a design with one or more components open in Fusion’s DESIGN workspace. This script will switch the UI from the DESIGN workspace to the MANUFACTURE workspace, create a new Manufacturing Model, and create an Additive Arrange using that manufacturing model as an input. The setup will select an MJF 3D printer from Fusion’s machine library and a print setting from the print setting library. All components in the Manufacturing model will be automatically arranged within the build volume of the selected MJF machine. |
| [Hole and Pocket Recognition API Sample](HoleAndPocketRecognition_Sample.md) | This sample script demonstrates three different methods for feature recognition: one for holes and two for pockets. The script starts by creating a simple component which is then used to demonstrate the three methods. After the features are recognised they are coloured and milling and drilling operations are created for each feature. RecognizedHoleGroup returns a list of BRepFaces that can be used as selections for the drilling operation. RecognizedPocket also return some BRepFaces but it needs additional processing before the output can be used for creating machining operations. The sample script demonstrates a couple of different methods, including finding the pocket BRepFaces and creating sketches from the recognized pockets. This script works only if the Manufacturing Extension is active. |
| [Manufacturing Workflow API Sample](ManufacturingWorkflowAPISample_Sample.md) | Manufacturing Workflow API Sample This sample script starts by creating a simple component which is then used to describe a milling workflow. It creates a setup, a few operations, pick some tools from a Fusion sample tool library using loops and queries and ends up post-processing the operations out using an NC Program. |
| [Set Vise Origin As Setup WCS Origin API Sample](SetViseOriginAsSetupWCSOrigin_Sample.md) | This sample script demonstrates how to define our setup WCS origin relative to our vise origin from either a component, a sketch point or a joint origin. The Work Coordinate System is a reference point set in our CAM workspace and on our machine. All machine coordinates are drawn from the WCS. This script demonstrates defining the WCS by each of 4 alternative methods: Setup by default with no origin defined. Setup using vise origin as WCS origin. Setup using a sketch point as WCS origin. Setup using a joint origin as WCS origin. |
| [Turning Workflow API Sample](Turning_Workflow_API_Sample_Sample.md) | Turning Workflow API Sample This sample script starts by opening a simple component which is then used to describe a basic turning workflow. It creates a setup, a few operations, pick some tools from a Fusion sample tool library using loops and queries and ends up post-processing the operations out using an NC Program. |
