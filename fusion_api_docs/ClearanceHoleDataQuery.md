# ClearanceHoleDataQuery Object

Derived from: [Base](Base.md) Object  

## Description

This object provides methods to query the clearance hole to find valid definitions for creating a clearance hole.

## Methods

| Name | Description |
|----|----|
| [allFastenerTypes](ClearanceHoleDataQuery_allFastenerTypes.md) | This method returns an array of all the available fastener types for the given standard. To get the available standards, use the allStandards property. |
| [allSizes](ClearanceHoleDataQuery_allSizes.md) | This method returns an array of all the sizes for the given standard and fastener type. Valid standards and fastener types can be obtained using the allStandards and allFastenerTypes functions. |
| [classType](ClearanceHoleDataQuery_classType.md) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [create](ClearanceHoleDataQuery_create.md) | Static method to create a new ClearanceHoleDataQuery object. The ClearanceHoleDataQuery object is a utility object that provides methods to query for the valid clearance hole definitions defined in Fusion. This object provides similar functionality as the hole command dialog to find valid clearance standards, fastener types, and sizes, which can be used to create clearance hole features. |
| [standardCustomName](ClearanceHoleDataQuery_standardCustomName.md) | Method that returns the custom name for a given standard. The custom name is the localized name of the standard using the current language specified for Fusion. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [allStandards](ClearanceHoleDataQuery_allStandards.md) | This method returns an array of all the available standards. The standards' names are always English. This English name should be used in the other methods that take the standard as an input argument. If you need to display the standard name to the user, you can use the standardCustomName method To get the localized name. |
| [isValid](ClearanceHoleDataQuery_isValid.md) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectType](ClearanceHoleDataQuery_objectType.md) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. It's often useful to use this in combination with the classType method to see if an object is a certain type. For example: if obj.objectType == adsk.core.Point3D.classType(): |
