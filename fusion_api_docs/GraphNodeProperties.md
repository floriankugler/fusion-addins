Because this is a preview of future functionality, there is the possibility that it will change, which will possibly break any existing programs that use this functionality.

## Description

A collection of properties of a graph node.

## Methods

| Name | Description |
|----|----|
| [classType](GraphNodeProperties_classType.md) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [item](GraphNodeProperties_item.md) | Function that returns the specified property using an index into the collection. |
| [itemByName](GraphNodeProperties_itemByName.md) | Returns the property with the specified internal name. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [count](GraphNodeProperties_count.md) | The number of items in the collection. |
| [isValid](GraphNodeProperties_isValid.md) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectType](GraphNodeProperties_objectType.md) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. It's often useful to use this in combination with the classType method to see if an object is a certain type. For example: if obj.objectType == adsk.core.Point3D.classType(): |

## Samples

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Volumetric Custom Feature API Sample](VolumetricCustomFeatureSample_Sample.md) | Demonstrates how to create a Volumetric Custom Feature using the API for graph creation. To run the sample script, have a document open in Fusion’s DESIGN workspace. This script will create a component with a box by sketching then extruding that sketch. It will then use that box as a boundary body and create a Volumetric Custom Feature. The script will the create a gyroid lattice using the Volumetric Model API with the appropriate Graphs, Nodes and Connections for a minimal example. Finally, the script will convert that Volumetric Model to Mesh using the API and the VolumetricModelToMeshFeature. |
