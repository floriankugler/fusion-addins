# CheckBoxControlDefinition Object

Derived from: [ControlDefinition](ControlDefinition.md) Object  

## Description

Represents the information used to define a check box. This isn't the visible check box control but is the information needed to create a check box control and fully defines a check box except for it's position within the user interface.

## Methods

| Name | Description |
|----|----|
| [classType](CheckBoxControlDefinition_classType.md) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |

## Properties

| [objectType](CheckBoxControlDefinition_objectType.md) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. It's often useful to use this in combination with the classType method to see if an object is a certain type. For example: if obj.objectType == adsk.core.Point3D.classType(): |
