## Description

Returns a JointMotion object that defines the motion relationship between the two geometries.  

This property will return null in the case where the jointType property returns InferredJointType.

## Syntax

"joint_var" is a variable referencing a Joint object.  

```python
# Get the value of the property.
propertyValue = joint_var.jointMotion
```

## Property Value

This is a read only property whose value is a [JointMotion](JointMotion.md).
