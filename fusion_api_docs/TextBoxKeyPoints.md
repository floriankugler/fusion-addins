# TextBoxKeyPoints Enumerator

## Description

Defines the nine key points that exist for a sketch text box and can be used as the origin when rotating the text. The named positions are with respect to the text box. For example when the text box has not been rotated the top-left key point will be the point in the upper-left corner of the text box. If the text box has been rotated 180 degrees, the top-left key point will be the point in the lower-right corner of the text box.
