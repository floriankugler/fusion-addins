# BRepCell Object

Derived from: [Base](Base.md) Object  

## Description

Object that represents an existing BRepCell.

## Methods

| Name | Description |
|----|----|
| [classType](BRepCell_classType.md) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [cellBody](BRepCell_cellBody.md) | Returns a BRepBody that represents this cell. This is a transient B-Rep body. |
| [isSelected](BRepCell_isSelected.md) | Gets and sets whether the cell is selected. For a Trim feature a selected cell is removed, whereas for a boundary fill feature, a selected cell is kept and used in the feature operation. |
| [isValid](BRepCell_isValid.md) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectType](BRepCell_objectType.md) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. It's often useful to use this in combination with the classType method to see if an object is a certain type. For example: if obj.objectType == adsk.core.Point3D.classType(): |
| [sourceTools](BRepCell_sourceTools.md) | Returns the tools that we're using in the definition of this cell. |
