# MoveFeatureTranslateAlongEntityDefinition Object

Derived from: [MoveFeatureDefinition](MoveFeatureDefinition.md) Object  

## Description

The MoveFeatureTranslateAlongEntityDefinition object defines a move feature described by a translation in the direction defined by a specified entity.

## Methods

| Name | Description |
|----|----|
| [classType](MoveFeatureTranslateAlongEntityDefinition_classType.md) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [distance](MoveFeatureTranslateAlongEntityDefinition_distance.md) | Gets the model parameter that controls the offset distance. You can use properties on the returned ModelParameter object to edit the offset distance. |
| [isValid](MoveFeatureTranslateAlongEntityDefinition_isValid.md) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [linearEntity](MoveFeatureTranslateAlongEntityDefinition_linearEntity.md) | Gets and sets the linear entity that defines the direction of the move. This can be a linear BRepEdge, ConstructionAxis, or a SketchLine. The entity defines the direction, not the distance. The natural direction of the entity defines the translation direction. To set this property, you need to position the timeline marker to immediately before this feature. This can be accomplished using the following code: thisFeature.timelineObject.rollTo(True) |
| [objectType](MoveFeatureTranslateAlongEntityDefinition_objectType.md) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. It's often useful to use this in combination with the classType method to see if an object is a certain type. For example: if obj.objectType == adsk.core.Point3D.classType(): |
| [parentMoveFeature](MoveFeatureTranslateAlongEntityDefinition_parentMoveFeature.md) | Returns the parent MoveFeature object |
