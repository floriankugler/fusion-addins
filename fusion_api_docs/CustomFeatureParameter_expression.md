This functionality is provided as a preview of intended future API capabilities. You are encouraged to use it and report any problems or suggestions using the [Fusion API and Scripts](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-360-api-and-scripts/bd-p/22) forum.  

Because this is a preview of future functionality, there is the possibility that it will change, which will possibly break any existing programs that use this functionality. Because of that, you should never deliver any programs that use any preview capabilities. For a distributed program, you should wait until it has moved from preview to released state.

## Description

Gets and sets the expression used to calculate the value of the parameter. This is the equivalent of the "Expression" column in the Parameters dialog. Numeric parameters can be defined by a simple expression like "6.25", which will be interpreted based on whatever the default units are for the document. For example, if the units are set to millimeters, the value will be 6.25 mm; if the units are inches, it will be 6.25 inches. The expression can also contain the units so "6.25 in" will always be evaluated as inches regardless of the document units.  

An expression can also contain references to other parameters and use equations. For example, the expression "Length / 2" is valid for a numeric parameter as long as there is a numeric parameter named "Length". Expressions can also be used for text parameters, such as concatenating two other text parameters. For example, if there are two existing text parameters named text1 and text2, the expression for another text parameter can be "text1 + text2". More complex equations can also be used with text parameters like "if (Length < 20 mm; 'Short'; 'Long')" where "Length" is a numeric parameter. The resulting string can be obtained using the textValue property.
