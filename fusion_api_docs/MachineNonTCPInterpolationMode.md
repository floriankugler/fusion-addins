## Description

## Methods

| Name | Value | Description |
|----|----|----|
| MachineNonTCPInterpolationMode_IndependentAxes | 1 | Moves the axes together, completing the motion simultaneously, although the tool's tip may deviate from the direct line between the start and finish points. |
| MachineNonTCPInterpolationMode_SynchronizedAxes | 0 | Moves the axes independently at maximum speed, potentially resulting in different completion times for each axis |
