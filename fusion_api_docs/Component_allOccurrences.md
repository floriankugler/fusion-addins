## Description

Returns all of the occurrences in the assembly regardless of their level within the assembly structure. The returned list is read-only.

## Syntax

"component_var" is a variable referencing a Component object.  

```python
# Get the value of the property.
propertyValue = component_var.allOccurrences
```

## Property Value

This is a read only property whose value is an [OccurrenceList](OccurrenceList.md).

| --- | --- |
| [Create Setups From Hole Recognition API Sample](CreateSetupsFromHoleRecognition_Sample.md) | This sample script demonstrates how to create a correctly oriented setup using Hole Recognition functionality. The Fusion Manufacturing Extension is required for Hole Recognition. The script starts by opening a sample model from the CAM Samples folder via its URN. The model comprises a 3 way coupling containing holes in various orientations and mounted on a fixture. A reference setup is created for the model using a simple stock mode and offsets. The Hole Recognition feature of the Fusion Manufacturing Extension creates 5 hole groups containing 11 holes between them. For each unique hole group vector captured, a new setup is created and its orientation transformed to match the vector. |
| [Get Volume of Active Design API Sample](GetsVolumeOfActiveDesign_Sample.md) | Traverses through the active design and totals the volume of every body within the design. |
| [Set Vise Origin As Setup WCS Origin API Sample](SetViseOriginAsSetupWCSOrigin_Sample.md) | This sample script demonstrates how to define our setup WCS origin relative to our vise origin from either a component, a sketch point or a joint origin. The Work Coordinate System is a reference point set in our CAM workspace and on our machine. All machine coordinates are drawn from the WCS. This script demonstrates defining the WCS by each of 4 alternative methods: Setup by default with no origin defined. Setup using vise origin as WCS origin. Setup using a sketch point as WCS origin. Setup using a joint origin as WCS origin. |
