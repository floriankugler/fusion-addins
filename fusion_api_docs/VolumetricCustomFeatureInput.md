## Description

An input object for creating a volumetric custom feature.

## Methods

| Name | Description |
|----|----|
| [classType](VolumetricCustomFeatureInput_classType.md) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [boundaryBody](VolumetricCustomFeatureInput_boundaryBody.md) | The boundary body of the volumetric model. |
| [isValid](VolumetricCustomFeatureInput_isValid.md) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectType](VolumetricCustomFeatureInput_objectType.md) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. It's often useful to use this in combination with the classType method to see if an object is a certain type. For example: if obj.objectType == adsk.core.Point3D.classType(): |

## Samples

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Volumetric Custom Feature API Sample](VolumetricCustomFeatureSample_Sample.md) | Demonstrates how to create a Volumetric Custom Feature using the API for graph creation. To run the sample script, have a document open in Fusion’s DESIGN workspace. This script will create a component with a box by sketching then extruding that sketch. It will then use that box as a boundary body and create a Volumetric Custom Feature. The script will the create a gyroid lattice using the Volumetric Model API with the appropriate Graphs, Nodes and Connections for a minimal example. Finally, the script will convert that Volumetric Model to Mesh using the API and the VolumetricModelToMeshFeature. |
