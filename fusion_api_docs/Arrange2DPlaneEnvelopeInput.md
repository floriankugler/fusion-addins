# Arrange2DPlaneEnvelopeInput Object

Derived from: [Arrange2DEnvelopeInput](Arrange2DEnvelopeInput.md) Object  

## Description

This object is used to specify the input needed to define a 2D rectangular envelope.

## Methods

| Name | Description |
|----|----|
| [classType](Arrange2DPlaneEnvelopeInput_classType.md) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [envelopeSpacing](Arrange2DPlaneEnvelopeInput_envelopeSpacing.md) | For a 2D plane envelope, this defines the spacing between envelopes when there is more than one. This value will become a parameter when the arrangement is created. If the ValueInput is created using a real number it is in centimeters. If you use a string, it is evaluated the same as a value would be in the command dialog and uses the current document units. For example, if the document units are inch and you specific "0.25" it will result in 1/4 inch clearance. You can also specify the units as part of the expression, such as "0.25 in + 2 mm". And you can define equations like "ToolDia + 2 mm" where "ToolDia" is an existing parameter. |
| [frameWidth](Arrange2DPlaneEnvelopeInput_frameWidth.md) | Specifies the minimum distance between the components in the arrangement and the envelope frame. This value will become a parameter when the arrangement is created. If the ValueInput is created using a real number it is in centimeters. If you use a string, it is evaluated the same as a value would be in the command dialog and uses the current document units. For example, if the document units are inch and you specific "0.25" it will result in 1/4 inch clearance. You can also specify the units as part of the expression, such as "0.25 in + 2 mm". And you can define equations like "ToolDia + 2 mm" where "ToolDia" is an existing parameter. |
| [isFlipped](Arrange2DPlaneEnvelopeInput_isFlipped.md) | Specifies if the arrangement of objects is so they are above or X-Y plane of the envelope. Defaults to false so the objects are above the construction plane, profile or face. |
| [isPartialArrangeAllowed](Arrange2DPlaneEnvelopeInput_isPartialArrangeAllowed.md) | Gets and sets if a partial arrange is allowed. If true, it will still create a result when there is not enough space on the envelope to fit all of the components. Components are arranged until all the available space is used up. The components that were not included in the partial arrangement are highlighted in the components list. If the envelope size increases, the arrangement recalculates to include the components that did not previously fit in the arrangement. |
| [isValid](Arrange2DPlaneEnvelopeInput_isValid.md) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [length](Arrange2DPlaneEnvelopeInput_length.md) | Gets and sets length of the envelope. This is the size of the envelope as measured along the X axis of the specified construction plane. This value will become a parameter when the arrangement is created. If the ValueInput is created using a real number it is in centimeters. If you use a string, it is evaluated the same as a value would be in the command dialog and uses the current document units. For example, if the document units are inch and you specific "0.25" it will result in 1/4 inch clearance. Using a string, you can also specify the units as part of the expression, such as "0.25 in + 2 mm". And you can define equations like "PartSize + 2 mm" where "PartSize" is an existing parameter. |
| [objectSpacing](Arrange2DPlaneEnvelopeInput_objectSpacing.md) | Specifies the minimum clearance between components in the arrangement. for a 3D layout this also specified the distance between the components in the Z direction. This value will become a parameter when the arrangement is created. If the ValueInput is created using a real number it is in centimeters. If you use a string, it is evaluated the same as a value would be in the command dialog and uses the current document units. For example, if the document units are inch and you specific "0.25" it will result in 1/4 inch clearance. You can also specify the units as part of the expression, such as "0.25 in + 2 mm". And you can define equations like "ToolDia + 2 mm" where "ToolDia" is an existing parameter. |
| [objectType](Arrange2DPlaneEnvelopeInput_objectType.md) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. It's often useful to use this in combination with the classType method to see if an object is a certain type. For example: if obj.objectType == adsk.core.Point3D.classType(): |
| [originXOffset](Arrange2DPlaneEnvelopeInput_originXOffset.md) | Gets and sets the X offset of the envelope from the origin of the construction plane. This value defaults to zero. This value will become a parameter when the arrangement is created. If the ValueInput is created using a real number it is in centimeters. If you use a string, it is evaluated the same as a value would be in the command dialog and uses the current document units. For example, if the document units are inch and you specific "0.25" it will result in 1/4 inch clearance. Using a string, you can also specify the units as part of the expression, such as "0.25 in + 2 mm". And you can define equations like "PartSize + 2 mm" where "PartSize" is an existing parameter. |
| [originYOffset](Arrange2DPlaneEnvelopeInput_originYOffset.md) | Gets and sets the Y offset of the envelope from the origin of the construction plane. This value defaults to zero. This value will become a parameter when the arrangement is created. If the ValueInput is created using a real number it is in centimeters. If you use a string, it is evaluated the same as a value would be in the command dialog and uses the current document units. For example, if the document units are inch and you specific "0.25" it will result in 1/4 inch clearance. Using a string, you can also specify the units as part of the expression, such as "0.25 in + 2 mm". And you can define equations like "PartSize + 2 mm" where "PartSize" is an existing parameter. |
| [placementClearance](Arrange2DPlaneEnvelopeInput_placementClearance.md) | Specifies the distance of the components and the bottom of the envelope. This raises the components above the X-Y plane of the specified construction plane. This value will become a parameter when the arrangement is created. If the ValueInput is created using a real number it is in centimeters. If you use a string, it is evaluated the same as a value would be in the command dialog and uses the current document units. For example, if the document units are inch and you specific "0.25" it will result in 1/4 inch clearance. You can also specify the units as part of the expression, such as "0.25 in + 2 mm". And you can define equations like "ToolDia + 2 mm" where "ToolDia" is an existing parameter. |
| [plane](Arrange2DPlaneEnvelopeInput_plane.md) | Gets and sets the construction plane that will be used for this envelope. |
| [quantity](Arrange2DPlaneEnvelopeInput_quantity.md) | Specifies the number of envelopes that can be used. The default value is -1 which means there is no limit. This value will become a parameter when the arrangement is created. When created with a real value it must be a whole number. You can also use a string where it is interpreted the same as when entered in the command dialog. The expression must result in a unitless whole number. It's also possible to use an equation like "Total / 4" where "Total" is an existing parameter and be evenly divided by four. |
| [width](Arrange2DPlaneEnvelopeInput_width.md) | Gets and sets the width of the envelope. This is the size of the envelope as measured along the Y axis of the specified construction plane. This value will become a parameter when the arrangement is created. If the ValueInput is created using a real number it is in centimeters. If you use a string, it is evaluated the same as a value would be in the command dialog and uses the current document units. For example, if the document units are inch and you specific "0.25" it will result in 1/4 inch clearance. Using a string, you can also specify the units as part of the expression, such as "0.25 in + 2 mm". And you can define equations like "PartSize + 2 mm" where "PartSize" is an existing parameter. |
