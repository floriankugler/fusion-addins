# Operation.generatedDataCollection Property

Parent Object: [Operation](Operation.md)  

## Description

Get the generated data associated with a given operation base instance. The type of data depends on the strategy type and might not be available for all strategy types. The available types can be found in GeneratedData.cs

## Syntax

"operation_var" is a variable referencing an Operation object.  

```python
# Get the value of the property.
propertyValue = operation_var.generatedDataCollection
```

## Property Value

This is a read only property whose value is a [GeneratedDataCollection](GeneratedDataCollection.md).

## Samples

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Additive Manufacturing FFF API Sample](AdditiveFFFManufacturingSample_Sample.md) | Demonstrates how to automate the creation of an additive FFF manufacturing setup and generate a toolpath. To run the sample script, have a design with one or more components open in Fusion’s DESIGN workspace. This script will switch the UI from the DESIGN workspace to the MANUFACTURE workspace, create a new Manufacturing Model, and create an Additive setup using that manufacturing model as an input. The setup will select an FFF 3D printer from Fusion’s machine library and a print setting from the print setting library. All components in the Manufacturing model will be automatically oriented and arranged within the build area of the selected FFF machine. This script will also create support structures, if required, based on the orientation of each component. Finally, the script generates the toolpath for the active setup and lets the user choose if they wish to post process the resulting toolpath or if they want to simulate it. |
| [Additive Manufacturing SLA API Sample](AdditiveSLAManufacturingSample_Sample.md) | Demonstrates how to automate the creation of an additive SLA manufacturing setup. To run the sample script, have a design with one or more components open in Fusion’s DESIGN workspace. This script will switch the UI from the DESIGN workspace to the MANUFACTURE workspace, create a new Manufacturing Model, and create an Additive setup using that manufacturing model as an input. The setup will select a SLA 3D printer from Fusion’s machine library and a print setting from the print setting library. All components in the Manufacturing model will be automatically oriented and arranged within the build area of the selected SLA machine. This script will also create support structures, based on the orientation of each component. The support and orientation operations are created from a template. The script further demonstrates how to wrap script code into a command such that only one undo entry is created for the entire script instead of one entry per internal action. |
