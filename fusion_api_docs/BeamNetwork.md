Because this is a preview of future functionality, there is the possibility that it will change, which will possibly break any existing programs that use this functionality. Because of that, you should never deliver any programs that use any preview capabilities. For a distributed program, you should wait until it has moved from preview to released state.

## Description

A geometry reference property that defines a BeamNetwork object which is commonly used in discrete lattice structures.

## Methods

| Name | Description |
|----|----|
| [classType](BeamNetwork_classType.md) | Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType(). |
| [create](BeamNetwork_create.md) | The creator function of the BeamNetwork object. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [beams](BeamNetwork_beams.md) | The beams of the beam network. Each beam is a pair of vertex indices. The size of the array should be a multiple of 2, and equal to the length of the radii array. |
| [isValid](BeamNetwork_isValid.md) | Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference. |
| [objectType](BeamNetwork_objectType.md) | This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object. It's often useful to use this in combination with the classType method to see if an object is a certain type. For example: if obj.objectType == adsk.core.Point3D.classType(): |
| [radii](BeamNetwork_radii.md) | The radii of the beams. Each radius is a double value. The radii define the radius of one end of the beam that corresponds to the same index in the beams array. The size of the array should be a multiple of 2, and equal to the length of the beams array. |
| [vertices](BeamNetwork_vertices.md) | The vertices of the beam network. Each vertex is a Point3D. |
